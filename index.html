                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Brendon and this is my portfolio. I live in Pontiac, Mi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My contact information can be found at the bottom.

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy programming, the ability to create tools that can be used in
                    life is beathtaking and having the ability to contribute to such a system
                    gives me great excitement. Having the chance to brainstorm and contribute to the future is why
                    it's my passion to program. I have found I am very versatile in working by myself or in a group,
                    though I do love working
                    with other people. Being able to see passion of what I love to do in others really makes me feel
                    like I have chose a career that has a purpose.
                    Programming isn't all my life though I also enjoy nature walks and kayaking.
                </p>
